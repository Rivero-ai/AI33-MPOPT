# AI33-MPOPT

Created by Rolando Rivero (2024)

## Overview

Revolutionary 33-Multiverse Framework merging quantum computing with advanced visualization for understanding universe creation and force unification.

## Technical Preview

The framework combines quantum geometry with field equations:

```python
def evolve_unified_field(self, t, dt):
    """Ψ₃₃-MPOPT = ∫[ K(Φ₃₃) x Π₄ x Σ ] x [ DE(θ,Ω) + DM(Ω,Φ) + T(Ψ)Ω + S(10.33) ] dτ"""
    # Unified field evolution through 33 connected universes
