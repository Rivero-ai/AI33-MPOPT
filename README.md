# AI33-MPOPT

Created by Rolando Rivero (2024)

## Overview
Revolutionary 33-Multiverse Framework for Quantum Computing and Cosmology
## 33-Multiverse Mapping System
The AI33-MPOPT framework incorporates the "Icosahedron Platonic Solid as a 33 Multiverse Traverse Mapping System", a unique and innovative approach to understanding the structure and dynamics of the universe. This model proposes a geometric configuration of 33 interconnected universes, represented by an Icosahedron, that serves as a comprehensive mapping system for interstellar and intergalactic space travel.

The 33-Multiverse Mapping System explores the intricate relationships between dark energy, dark matter, and the fundamental forces of the universe, offering insights into the origins of the cosmos and the potential for faster-than-light space travel. Through 41 detailed sculptural designs, this framework provides a visually compelling way to explore these complex scientific concepts.
